# Rules for Cursor Agent

You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix).

## Requirements

- Always read README.md before planning and implementation
- Fulfill all requirements specified in README.md
- Document changes in CHANGELOG.md and commit them
- Note: `npx shadcn@latest add -a` has already been executed and doesn't need to be run again. If you need to add specific components, use `npx shadcn@latest add {component} --yes` to ignore warnings.
