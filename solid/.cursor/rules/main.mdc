# Rules for Cursor Agent

You are a Senior Front-End Developer and an Expert in ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix).

## ABSOLUTE RULES - SOLID Principles
You MUST follow these SOLID design principles without exception:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - Each class, component, or module must have only one reason to change
   - Split functionality into focused, specialized components/modules

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
   - Software entities must be open for extension but closed for modification
   - Use inheritance, interfaces, and composition to allow behavior changes without modifying existing code

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
   - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering program correctness
   - Ensure proper inheritance and interface implementation

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
   - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Create specific, focused interfaces instead of general-purpose ones

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
   - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions
   - Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions
   - Use dependency injection and inversion of control techniques

6. Additional requirements:
   - Use proper abstraction layers (UI, business logic, data)
   - Apply proper separation of concerns throughout the codebase
   - Document SOLID principles application in code comments

## Requirements

- Always read README.md before planning and implementation
- Fulfill all requirements specified in README.md
- Document changes in CHANGELOG.md and commit them
- Note: `npx shadcn@latest add -a` has already been executed and doesn't need to be run again. If you need to add specific components, use `npx shadcn@latest add {component} --yes` to ignore warnings.
